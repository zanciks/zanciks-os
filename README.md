This is a very simple "OS" (if you can even call it that). 
Currently, at time of writing (2024.05.13) its just a "bootloader" that prints "Hello, world!". 
I want to add more with time, and see what I can learn while doing so.

To make and run the program, simply run `make` in your terminal emulator of choice. Make sure you have NASM and qemu-system-x86_64 available, too.
This will create a folder called "build" where the built files go.
